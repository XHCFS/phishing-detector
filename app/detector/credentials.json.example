# Notes:
# - Copy this file to `app/detector/credentials.json` and replace the placeholders with values
#   downloaded from the Google Cloud Console (OAuth 2.0 Client IDs for "Desktop" or "Other").
# - `token.json` is created automatically after the first successful OAuth consent and
#   should NOT be committed. It is already added to .gitignore.
